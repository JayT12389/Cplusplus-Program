// Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
Airgead Banking is well known in the community. They often sponsor schools and have recently decided to partner with the local high school to develop a program that will teach students the concepts of fiscal responsibility (such as living within their means and spending less than they make) via an interactive system. The initial focus for this project will be on investing and the power of compound interest. You will develop an application that allows users to see how their investments will grow over time. Airgead Banking has provided you with a list of functional requirements that describe what they need their application to do.

//What did you do particularly well?
The code was really good and it works well. My flowchart also explains your solution very clearly.

//Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
The code was well written, I dont think i would alter it in any way.

//Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Printing the results to the table, was an opportunity because of the details involved. To over come this obsticle i used tools over the internet as well as tutor support. Practicing on an IDE gives ne the opportunity to continue to growth while being developed in programming.

//What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work? Many and many skills will transfer to other projects as I have found most programming has some of the same concepts just slightly different.

//How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 
To make code maintainable, readable, and accessible, focus on practices like using descriptive variable names, writing clear comments, following consistent coding standards, breaking down complex logic into smaller functions, adhering to the DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself), and ensuring proper documentation to explain the code's purpose and functionality for both current and future developers.
